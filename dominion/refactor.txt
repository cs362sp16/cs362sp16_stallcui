Assignment 1 - Refactoring details

council room:

To refactor, I created a function play_council_room 
(with return type int for error checking). It is
called in the appropriate place in cardEffect. I then
examined the current implementation of council
room in order to determine which parameters to pass
to the play_council_room function; these were
currentPlayer, a pointer to the gameState state, 
and handPos. I then implemented drawing four cards
(again with error checking in order to handle
errors in drawCard). I then increased the number
of buys in the turn, then discarded the council
room card via the discardCard function, and returned
success. In cardEffect, I created a new variable to 
store the result of play_council_room, and in
cardEffect I return failure if success is not 0
(the default success value of play_council_room),
and otherwise return 0 as in the original functionality
of the switch statement.

smithy:
To refactor smithy, I again first examined the
variables needed in the existing smithy functionality.
They are currentPlayer, state, and handPos. Smithy
draws three cards, then discards the card from the
hand; I used existing draw and discard functions to
complete this functionality, again with error checking
for drawCard as in the council room function.
Finally, I performed similar error checking as in
council room.
