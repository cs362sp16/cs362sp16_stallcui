Assignment 1 - Refactoring details

council room: refactored functino play_council_room

To refactor, I created a function play_council_room 
(with return type int for error checking). It is
called in the appropriate place in cardEffect. I then
examined the current implementation of council
room in order to determine which parameters to pass
to the play_council_room function; these were
currentPlayer, a pointer to the gameState state, 
and handPos. I then implemented drawing four cards
(again with error checking in order to handle
errors in drawCard). I then increased the number
of buys in the turn, then discarded the council
room card via the discardCard function, and returned
success. In cardEffect, I created a new variable to 
store the result of play_council_room, and in
cardEffect I return failure if success is not 0
(the default success value of play_council_room),
and otherwise return 0 as in the original functionality
of the switch statement.

smithy: refactored function play_smithy

To refactor smithy, I again first examined the
variables needed in the existing smithy functionality.
They are currentPlayer, state, and handPos. Smithy
draws three cards, then discards the card from the
hand; I used existing draw and discard functions to
complete this functionality, again with error checking
for drawCard as in the council room function.
Finally, I performed similar error checking as in
council room.

village: refactored function play_village

To refactor village, first I looked at the functionality
in cardEffect (+1 card, +2 actions) and then which
parameters were needed (currentPlayer, pointer to 
gameState state, handPos) and copied them into
the new function. I used existing functionality
to draw a card (with error checking as in the
other functions), increased the number of actions,
and discarded the card before returning 0. Finally,
I used the same error checking scheme in cardEffect
as in the other refactorings.


salvager: refactored function play_salvager

I determined a new function has to be passed the vars
choice1, a pointer to state, currentPlayer and handPos.
Salvager then gives +1 buy, and if choice1, gives
coins equal to a chosen card's cost that is then trashed.
This means that the function will need to discard the chosen
card as well as the salvager card. Using the built-in 
functionalities for discarding, getting coins, and increasing
the nubmer of buys, I wrote the play_salvager function,
then called it in  the appropriate part of the switch statement
in cardEffect.
