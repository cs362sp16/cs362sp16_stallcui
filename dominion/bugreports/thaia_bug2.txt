BUG 2

Card tested: cutpurse
Expected behavior: test should end with 6 coins in player's hand
Actual behavior: test does not end with 6 coins in player's hand

Relevant tests:
stallcuicardtest4
	-asserts, after playing a cutpurse, that the number of coins
for the current player is 6
	-This is true due to design of test, which gives player 4
coins prior to cutpurse, and cutpurse gives two coins
	-see the file /thaia/card4.out, generated by the script
"thaiabug" in the main dominion folder

Relevant code: on line 705 of dominion.c, the function updateCoins()
is called. This may be the source of the bug, as I have had trouble
with updateCoins() in the past.
