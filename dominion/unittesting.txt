4. Code coverage

My code coverage was about 35%; the first test (on initializeGame)
added the largest amount, around 15%. This makes sense since a large
portion of the code of dominion.c is in initialization. Next was
the buyCard test, which added around 5% code coverage. This also makes
sense, as buyCard calls several other functions. Finally, the rest
of the tests added between 1-5% test coverage up to the total of
35%. This means, to me, that the most relevant tests were those that
tested initialization and buying. More in-depth tests would be
required to gain better code coverage for the rest of the functions,
but the rest of the functions are relatively small compared to
initializeGame.
