BUG 3

Card tested: baron
Expected behavior: If the option to gain an estate is selected by
the user, the card should indeed put an estate in the discard of 
the user
Actual behavior: Baron does not run the line of code to gain an
estate

Relevant tests:
stallcuiranda (random test)
	-bombards baron with all types of situations in which the card
could be played, including situations where the option to gain 
an estate is chosen
	-see file /thaia/randdumpadv.out, generated by the script
"thaiabug" in the main dominion folder
	-note that the ouptut from thaiabug for this case is the output
of tarantula script "handlerthaia" whose results are stored in 
/thaia/thaiatarantula

Relevant code: on line 918 of dominion.c, a call to gainCard() with the
argument "estate" is passed; this fucntion should put an estate
in the discard pile of the current player.
