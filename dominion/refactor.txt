Assignment 1 - Refactoring details

council room: refactored functino play_council_room

To refactor, I created a function play_council_room 
(with return type int for error checking). It is
called in the appropriate place in cardEffect. I then
examined the current implementation of council
room in order to determine which parameters to pass
to the play_council_room function; these were
currentPlayer, a pointer to the gameState state, 
and handPos. I then implemented drawing four cards
(again with error checking in order to handle
errors in drawCard). I then increased the number
of buys in the turn, then discarded the council
room card via the discardCard function, and returned
success. In cardEffect, I created a new variable to 
store the result of play_council_room, and in
cardEffect I return failure if success is not 0
(the default success value of play_council_room),
and otherwise return 0 as in the original functionality
of the switch statement.

smithy: refactored function play_smithy

To refactor smithy, I again first examined the
variables needed in the existing smithy functionality.
They are currentPlayer, state, and handPos. Smithy
draws three cards, then discards the card from the
hand; I used existing draw and discard functions to
complete this functionality, again with error checking
for drawCard as in the council room function.
Finally, I performed similar error checking as in
council room.

village: refactored function play_village

To refactor village, first I looked at the functionality
in cardEffect (+1 card, +2 actions) and then which
parameters were needed (currentPlayer, pointer to 
gameState state, handPos) and copied them into
the new function. I used existing functionality
to draw a card (with error checking as in the
other functions), increased the number of actions,
and discarded the card before returning 0. Finally,
I used the same error checking scheme in cardEffect
as in the other refactorings.


salvager: refactored function play_salvager

I determined a new function has to be passed the vars
choice1, a pointer to state, currentPlayer and handPos.
Salvager then gives +1 buy, and if choice1, gives
coins equal to a chosen card's cost that is then trashed.
This means that the function will need to discard the chosen
card as well as the salvager card. Using the built-in 
functionalities for discarding, getting coins, and increasing
the nubmer of buys, I wrote the play_salvager function,
then called it in  the appropriate part of the switch statement
in cardEffect.

steward: refactored function play_steward

I first determined the arugments needed to pass to the
play_steward function; these are choice1, currentPlayer, a
pointer to state, choice2, choice3, and handPos. Then, as the
function of the steward is to either draw 2 cards, gain 2
coins, or trash 2 cards from your hand, I implemented each
feature based on the choice1 variable's value with the existing
interface for drawing cards, gaining coins and trashing cards.
I did this in an error checking implemetnation similar to that 
of previous refactored functions, both within the function
(with drawCard) and in the switch statement in cardEffect, where
the call to play_steward is located.
