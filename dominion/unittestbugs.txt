BUGS

Tests failed were, in card test 3, the assertion 
that the minion added 2 coins, and in test 4 the 
assertions that the cutpurse would add coins and 
player 1 discards a card.

Both cards fail to correctly add coins. This 
could possibly be due to an error in scope, or 
an omission of adding coins to the current 
player's turn.

The cutupurse fails to force other players to 
discard cards; however, when the cutpurse is 
played during player 0's first turn, player 
1 does not have a hand. This bug then seems 
to be specifically when player 0 plays a 
cutpurse on turn 1, an unlikely scenario.
